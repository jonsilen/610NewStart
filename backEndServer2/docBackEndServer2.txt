This will be my front end server(ec2-18-217-219-13.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com ), which I called Server 2 in my AWS.

I intalled my Nagios Agent NRPE

	sudo apt-get install nagios-nrpe-server nagios-plugins

I had to change the server_address to my DNS of my nagios core server with: ec2-18-217-42-109.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
   
	sudo vim /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg
	sudo service nagios-nrpe-server restart

I installed MySQL

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install mysql-server
	sudo systemctl start mysql
	sudo mysqladmin -p -u
	sudo mysqladmin -p -u root

Logged in and created a new database called NJIT and created/added a new table 

	mysql -u root -p

Logged out of sql and "dumped" the contents of the database to a file called dumpNJIT.sql
(I did this to test)
	mysqldump -u root -p NJIT > dumpNJIT.sql
	vim dumpNJIT.sql

Exit out of the "test dump file"
Created a directory that with hold the backup data
	mkdir backupDB

I created a bash script that will backup the database in the backupDB directory and will delete the oldest file in the database on the 8th time it was backedup

	sudo vim backup.sh

I created a crontab that will run the bash script backup everyday at 8am

	sudo crontab -e
